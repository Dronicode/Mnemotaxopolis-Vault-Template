# Mnemotaxipolis

**Mnemotaxipolis** (`/nɪˈmɒ.tæk.sɪ.pɒl.ɪs/` *"nih-MOH-tak-sih-pol-iss"*) is a well-organized collection of ideas, information, and insights. 
Built in Obsidian with personal knowledge management (PKM) principles from the PARA, MoC, and Zettelkasten methods, it supports both structured and flexible note-taking.

The name **Mnemotaxipolis** is composed from three Greek roots:
- **Mnemo**: Representing memory, inspired by Mnemosyne the goddess of remembrance, signifying the its role as an archive of the mind.
- **Taxis**: Meaning order or arrangement, reflecting the systematic organization underpinning every note and thought.
- **Polis**: Evoking the image of a great and vibrant city where all ideas reside.

Together, this word signifies the convergence of memory, order, and expansive thought - a private sanctuary where all that is thought and learned is recorded and remembered. Mnemotaxipolis is more than just a library of notes; it is a continuously evolving companion on the lifelong journey of learning, a personal monument of knowledge and wisdom.
